- # ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Paola GonzÃ¡lez

I'm currently dreaming about making the computing world and data analytics field a more inclusive place with actual representation of women ang LGBTQ+ people in STE(A)M. Data and algorithms include all of us, we live with it, we dream with it, we work with it.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AI and statistical analysis in multiple dimensions.
From NLP and language modeling and unsupervised learning, to supervised learning for decision making processes. AI it's all about our focusing and learning growth.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my dissertation project that deals with Transformers, NLP and data justice and ethics.
Go check my repo about politicians' replies and monolingual translation if you're more interested into the details!
